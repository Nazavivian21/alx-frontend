Project Overview
Welcome to the first step of your journey in the Web Stack specialization. This project is the foundation of your web development learning, covering the basics of HTML. Throughout this project, you will get hands-on experience using HTML tags to structure a simple web page.

What You'll Learn:
How to structure a web page using HTML tags.
The fundamental building blocks of web development.
The importance of attention to detail (e.g., lowercase vs uppercase, correct spelling).
What This Project Does Not Cover:
CSS: You won’t be styling your page yet, so don’t worry if the page looks "ugly" — that’s completely normal! The focus here is on structure, not aesthetics.
Developer Tools: Although important, these tools will be covered in later projects.
Key Takeaways:
Details Matter: HTML is case-sensitive, so pay close attention to details like capitalization and spelling. Even a small mistake can lead to errors in your web page structure.
